# Freeboard Blocks


##Abstract
A while ago i bought a seaboard block secondhand, seemed fun and it was a really good offer, but then i realized that without one of the blocks or a specific app in windows or IOs phone (neither of wich i have or want to have) i could not change the settings for it, not even the mode or sensitivity of any of the dimensions.

So i dove into the developer material and figured that i could do something with what @Abhoth did, but take it further and make it standalone. and after a pair of sleepless nights i got it working properly, so here it is

##TL;DR

This script frees your roli seaboard blocks from the desktop applications and mobile(only IOS) app to change the settings, making them available in the board itself.

Basicly I made the mode switch and LED into a kind of a shift key, that enables:
- Changing between MPE and normal MIDI mode
- Activating Piano mode
- Setting different sensitivities to each of the mpe dimensions
- Setting midi channels

All this is done by using mode button + another key in the keyboard 

**OVERLAY COMING**

**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS COMING**
OF COURSE IF YOU BREAK YOUR DEVICE I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE, do it at your own risk, however this is not hacking anything and should something happen it should be within the warranty (DIDN'T LOOK IT UP, YOU DO YOU).
But basicly you need to download the [IDE](https://juce.com/blocks/code)paste the script and flash it to the device after connecting it

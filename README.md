# Freeboard Blocks

This script frees your roli seaboard blocks from the desktop applications and mobile(only IOS) app to change the settings, making them available in the board itself.

Basicly I made the mode switch and LED into a kind of a shift key, that enables:
- Changing between MPE and normal MIDI mode
- Activating Piano mode
- Setting different sensitivities to each of the mpe dimensions
- Setting midi channels

All this is done by using mode button + another key in the keyboard 

**OVERLAY COMING**

**INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS COMING**
But basicly you need to download the [IDE](https://juce.com/blocks/code)paste the script and flash it to the device after connecting it

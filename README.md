# Freeboard

This script frees your roli seaboard blocks from the desktop applications and mobile(only IOS) app to change the settings, making them available in the board itself.

Basicly I made the mode switch and LED into a kind of a shift key, that enables changing between MPE and normal MIDI mode, setting different sensitivities to each of the mpe dimensions and midi channels by using mode button + another key in the keyboard
